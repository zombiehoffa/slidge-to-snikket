# slidge-to-snikket
getting snikket and slidge to play nice
This outlines how I managed to get snikket and slidge working together in case anyone else needs to do this. I found the biggest difficulty being sparse snikket documentation. I do not claimt his is the right way to do this, I am just sharing how I got it to work to provide a hint for others treading the same sparsely document path I was on.
